Suncoast Linux Users Group Code of Conduct

With thanks to the [Serverless Meetup NYC](https://www.meetup.com/Serverless-NYC/)

The [Suncoast Linux Users Group (SLUG)](https://www.meetup.com/Suncoast-LUG/) is dedicated to providing a harassment-free community for everyone, regardless of sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, age, body size, race, nationality, or religious beliefs. We do not tolerate harassment of community members in any form. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the community at the discretion of the SLUG organizers.

Harassment includes offensive verbal or written comments related to sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, age, body size, race, nationality, or religious beliefs, deliberate intimidation, threats, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any SLUG event or communication channel. Community members asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in harassing behavior, the SLUG organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender, expulsion from  SLUG, and/or removal from an event. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an Serverless Meetup NYC organizer immediately, or as soon as you feel comfortable doing so.

The SLUG organizers are listed in [this Meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/Suncoast-LUG/) and can be contacted individually or as a group through Meetup.

If you have questions or feedback about this Code of Conduct please contact the organizers.
